## Fun fact

I wrote this addon using the Godot Rust bindings both for personal research and for a practical use case. 

I wanted to see how the Rust bindings work and how I can use them to write a Godot addon. 

The result is this addon, which is written in Rust and provides a tagging system for Godot. 

I hope you find it useful and that it helps you in your projects.

Also, I hope rust will gain more traction in the Godot community, as it is a great language for writing high-performance code in a few hours.
